Simplify3D Profile for the Monoprice Mini Delta - by dot_bob (Robert Mendon)

Usage:

In Simplify3D go to to Tool-Firmware Configuration and import the file MP Delta Firmware Profile.frm, 
next load the Monoprice Mini Delta profile.

Before using this profile verify the offset in the GCode script is correct for your machine.
The offset is found on the line "G29 P6 ZX.XX" where X.XX is the offset.  By default this offset is 0.37mm.

Misc:

The firmware for the MP Mini Delta enforces hardware flow control over the USB CDC link.  The delta will not
respond to any gcode command unless the serial hardware flow control is selected.  RTS needs to be
asserted for the MP Mini Delta to respond to commands.
